# AutoPR RL Agent 🚀

Welcome to **AutoPR RL Agent**, a cutting-edge reinforcement learning system designed to **automatically train AI agents triggered by Pull Requests (PRs)** on GitHub. This project aims to revolutionize how AI models improve iteratively through real developer workflows.

---

## 🚩 What is AutoPR RL Agent?

AutoPR RL Agent integrates:
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques for training agents dynamically.
- Seamless **GitHub Actions** automation triggered by PR events.
- Modular Python code with state-of-the-art deep learning libraries (like PyTorch).

With every PR, the agent **trains on new data or code changes**, improving continuously — making it a potential game-changer in automated software development and AI model fine-tuning.

---

## ✨ Features

- Trigger training on every pull request to the main branch.
- Manage dependencies via `requirements.txt`.
- Post success comments automatically on PRs with results.
- Fully configurable via GitHub Actions workflow.
- Easily extensible for new RL algorithms and environments.
- Clean, modular, and maintainable Python codebase.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled.
- Personal Access Token (`GH_PAT`) with repo permissions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venigallasivasrinivas/autopr_rl.git
   cd autopr_rl

	2.	Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Set your GH_PAT environment variable locally (for testing):

export GH_PAT="your_personal_access_token"

🧠 How It Works
	•	When a Pull Request is opened or updated on the main branch,
	•	The GitHub Actions workflow triggers,
	•	It sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs the RL agent training script,
	•	On success, it posts a comment on the PR confirming the training completion.

The RL agent uses PyTorch to learn and adapt from the changes made in each PR, enabling continuous, automatic improvement.

🔧 Usage

Run the training script locally:

python -m rl.rl_autopr

Make sure your environment variable GH_PAT is set to allow API interactions with GitHub.
